#+TITLE: gegede - General Geometry Description

* What is this?

The General Geometry Description (GGD) is a software system to generate a description of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry][constructive solid geometry]] specifically as used by [[http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/G4UsersDocuments/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Detector/geometry.html][Geant4]] or [[http://root.cern.ch/root/html534/guides/users-guide/Geometry.html][ROOT]] applications are as represented in [[http://cern.ch/gdml][GDML]] files.  It is implemented as a pure Python module =gegede=.  

** Dependencies

The core of GeGeDe relies on [[https://github.com/hgrecco/pint][Pint]] to enforce the consistent use of units.  

Additional functionality, particularly with regards to export, is provided by other modules:

 - GDML :: requires [[http://lxml.de/][lxml]] for emitting XML for GDML
 - ROOT :: (optional) for ROOT-based tests and direct ROOT export, PyROOT is needed
 - pivy :: (optional) for experimental FreeCAD support, pivy/coin3d is needed.

For running the tests [[https://nose.readthedocs.org][nose]] is useful.

* How do I use it?

GGD is designed along layers each of which allows the user-programmer access.

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :cmd dot :cmdline -Tpng :file highlevel.png :exports results 
  # note: github exposes this, ignore it
  digraph "highlevel" {
    rankdir=LR;
    params -> builders;
    builders -> objects;
    objects -> exports;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:highlevel.png]]


- params :: high level, human-centric configuration mechanism
- builders :: structured, procedural geometry constructor code 
- objects :: the in-memory representation of the final geometry
- export :: conversion to formats suitable to exchange the data with other applications.

At the highest level is a simple configuration language for end-user setting of parameters that are consumed by the next layer, the builders.  The builders are instances of classes which are responsible for constructing some portion of an overall geometry.  They may also manage some number of other (sub)builders to handle specific construction details.  The geometry is constructed by building an in-memory representation of general geometry objects.  Finally these objects may be exported into a number of forms including GDML, "plain old (Python) data" and JSON.  Each layer provides for extension to novel uses.

* Tutorial

Each layer contains a tutorial:

- [[./doc/configuration.org][Configuration]]
- [[./doc/builders.org][Builders]]
- [[./doc/construction.org][Construction]]
- [[./doc/exporting.org][Exporting]]

* Installation

GGD can be installed in the usual "Python way":

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ python setup.py install
#+END_EXAMPLE
