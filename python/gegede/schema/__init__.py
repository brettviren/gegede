'''The module holds the default schema definition for the geometry description elements.

The schema is a dictionary with an item for each major category in the
schema.  The item's value is in a form which is category dependent.

In general, leaf elements are described by a 2-tuple holding a data
member name and a prototypical value.  This value must be either an
object or a string that can be interpreted into an object in a
category-dependent manner.

Shapes ("solids") follow the conventions shows in Geant4 and ROOT:

http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/G4UsersDocuments/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Detector/geomSolids.html
http://root.cern.ch/root/html534/guides/users-guide/Geometry.html#shapes

 - the naming conventions of Geant4 are taken for the shapes (although we call them "shapes" not solids")

 - where applicable, the dimensions of solids are expressed as "half lengths" an such values are indicated with a "d" in their name (eg, "dx", "dy", "dz", "dphi").

 - all dimensions must be expressed in a quantity with the appropriate unit
